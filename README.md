# FireBioOptima
Code and data in support of "Finding floral and faunal species richness optima among active fire regimes" in review for Conservation Biology. Included are the code for bird and bat multi-species occupancy models (MSOM_full.R), plant richness models (plantmod_run.R), and the 'second-step' inference models for all three taxa (run_2step.R). Raw biodiversity data, environmental covariates, cross-validation scores (kfold_scores.csv), and pyrodiversity effects estimates (fdis_pars_supp.csv) are included in the data folder.
